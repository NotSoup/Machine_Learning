			Let's find some mf'ing datasets

	EXTRA CREDIT
		Boosting Decision Trees w/ some form of pruning & explain

- Search LLM in #A1 discord for threads about asking ChatGPT for analysis

- Look at Biases of each algo (Inductive, etc)

- Hypotheses can be about algo OR data, add "why" at end
	
- Test set is sacred: tune on train set only. Do NOT SHOW tuning through test set results. NOT EVEN VALIDATION CURVE

- Explain performance of datasets, even if it's bad ~after~ tuning

- Different performance metrics: Accuracy on set that has 90% one class, a 90% accuracy means very little
