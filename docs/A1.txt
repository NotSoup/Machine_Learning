			Let's find some mf'ing datasets

Need 2 datasets

Algorithms
	N.N. (any size, layer, activation function, etc)
	SVM (2 different kernels)
	KNN (adjust values of k and compare)
	EXTRA CREDIT
		Boosting Decision Trees w/ some form of pruning & explain
		how weak learners effect bias + variance
		
Now >>>> try to run ANY dataset through your scripts
	THEN start "looking at datasets"
