			Let's find some mf'ing datasets

Need 2 datasets

Algorithms
	N.N. (any size, layer, activation function, etc)
	SVM (2 different kernels)
	KNN (adjust values of k and compare)
	EXTRA CREDIT
		Boosting Decision Trees w/ some form of pruning & explain
		how weak learners effect bias + variance
		
Now >>>> try to run ANY dataset through your scripts
	THEN start "looking at datasets"

From Discord:

K-fold loss (ask ChatGPT)

Graphs
	1 Validation Curve x3
	1 Learning Curve x3
	
	1 loss curve w/ iterations|epochs x1 (NN)
	1 learning curve x1 (NN)
		I picked varying widths of one layer, 2 layers 
		setup with less-more, more-less, same-same, 
		and one 3 layer setup
