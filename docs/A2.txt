* Use discrete-value spaces (MIMIC cant be ran on continuous)
* MAXIMIZE fitness (do not MINIMIZE cost)
Problem 1: (multiple seeds w/ variance) highlight advantages of simulated annealing
Problem 2: (multiple seeds w/ variance) discuss genetic algorithm (apply MIMIC *only on this problem* for EXTRA CREDIT and compare to genetic algo)
Problem 3: (multiple seeds w/ variance) use all 3 algos to find weights for NN

Possible problems:
    - 4 peaks
    - k color
    - can steal anything from MLRose as long as 1 highlights GenAlg and the other SimAnn

Possible plots:
    - Fitness per Iteration
    - Iteration per time (compare # of iterations and speed of iterations)
    - Convergence

Make N random seeds to reuse and average (plot variance too)
