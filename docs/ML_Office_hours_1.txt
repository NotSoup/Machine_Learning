START PICKING OUT AND RUNNING DATASETS

Read A1 FAQ on Ed Discussions
	- A "better" algorithm can be based on training time or other
		metrics besides error function. Demonstrate this.

Accuracies under 80% call for a different approach (rule of thumb)
	But also needs an explination as to WHY its that bad

For dataset:
	- Avoid stock-market & fraud-detection data cuz weird
		- Fraud: small fraud sample vs very large non
		- Stock: too stochastic
	- Don't generate it yourself
	- Diversity in data types (hats have a bunch of categories
		vs stocks. Dont pick hats)
	- If all algorithms do equally well: don't use it
		EXPLAIN THEIR PERFORMANCE ANYWAYS! THATS THE POINT
		OF THE ASSIGNMENTS
	- Binary outputs kinda suck
	- Maybe 1 set with continuous features and 1 set with discrete
	- If it needs pre-processing, explaing how it effects any
		changes in outputs

Maybe re-watch 15-25

For reports:
	- Dig into the "why" instead of demo'ing data
	- Have a conclusion in the beginning, the "so what?"
		instead of 6 pages in

For hypothesis quiz:
	- always hit max word count
	- Q 4/5 for someone new to ML are hard to answer, so
		4 can come from paper/author. 5 can be whatever
		hypothesis you can ask following the paper.
